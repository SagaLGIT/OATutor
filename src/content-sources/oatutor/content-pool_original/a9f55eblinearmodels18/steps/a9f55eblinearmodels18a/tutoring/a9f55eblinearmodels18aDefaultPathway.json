We know that Ashburn is $$60$$ miles east and $$12$$ miles north of Timpson, so indicate a point A for Ashburn $$60$$ units right of Timpson and $$12$$ units up. This can be done by setting point T at the origin, $$(0,0)$$, and setting point A at $$(60,12)$$. We know that Garrison is perpendicular to the line connecting $$(0,0)$$ and $$(60,12)$$, based on the problem's given information. We can label Garrison as point G, at $$(20,0)$$ to represent being $$20$$ units east of point T. From the graph, we can tell that we are trying to find the point of the intersection between the line perpendicular to the line connecting T and A, that also goes through $$(20,0)$$.",
